This project attempts to create a simple waveform generator using the
Analog Devices AD9835 numerically controller oscillator with a dsPIC30F4011
digital signal controller. This project is also built heavily upon the dsPIC
port of FreeRTOS and includes relevant portions of it.

To build:
Modify executable paths in Makefile and run 'make' to generate the hex file.

This is intended to be built using the GNU make utility with the MPLAB C30
compiler. To use the MPLAB IDE, you will have to make an MPLAB project of this.
Several of the files from the dsPIC FreeRTOS demo have been modified to work
for the dsPIC30F as opposed to the dsPIC33F and this should be noted if you 
attempt to build up from the FreeRTOS project.
